###Assumptions

Assumes nationality of phone numbers isnt needed, so all phone numbers are exactly 10
characters long (so no 0 or +44, etc.)

Assumes no ones name, address, phone number or birthday contains an apostrophe, as
this character is used as the delimeter in the text file that stores the details.
e.g Joe'London'0192837465'01/02/3456

Assumes users understand what is meant by dd/mm/yyyy as this is the only accepted
format for birthday input.
